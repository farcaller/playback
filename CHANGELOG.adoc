## 0.5.2

### Fixed

- repeated calls to `playback.core/open-portal!` close Playback's previous Portal session and open a new one


## 0.5.1

### Improved

- `extend-default-optypes!` is now an idempotent function and allows a reset-to-default of the trace dispatch optype hierarchy.
- Code cleanup

## 0.5.0

### Added

- Babashka support!
- Tracing and replay of re-frame handlers and subscriptions, as well as other similar function registration operations
- Tracing of anonymous functions
- Tracing of loop/recur blocks
- Ability to extend Playback's optypes in order to trace/replay similar custom macros

### Fixed

- A new `defn` was being created on every replay due to the usage of `gensym`, thus increasingly polluting the namespace until the next reload. Function generation now uses a hardcoded suffix with extra-paranoid checks to eliminate the very minimal chance of overwriting an existing var (if you happen to be naming your functions `some-fn\__playback_core__`, Playback will let you know.)

### Improved

- Removed dependency on ClojureScript in Clojure-only projects due to the possibility of dependency conflicts (h/t @Cyrik)
- Extracted build/deployment code into https://github.com/gnl/build.simple[gnl/build.simple]
- Added spec validation for the minimal API
- Cleaned up a lot of messy, late-night, "how is this even working" kinda code


## 0.3.10
